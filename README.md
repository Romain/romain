### Hi there, I'm Romain ðŸ‘‹

I am a senior R&D engineer looking for a CTO position.

I founded a [webdevelopment company](https://www.bobbydigital.io/en) in 2012.\
I have also been the co-founder and CTO of [Strime](https://github.com/strimeapp/), which integrated [Start-Up Chile](https://www.startupchile.org/) in 2017.

:genie_man: I am really versed into PHP (Symfony, Laravel...) :elephant:, Javascript, NodeJs/ExpressJs, NestJS, HapiJS, VueJS and React.\
ðŸŒ± I am currently working on Go.

I am also a [published poet](https://tangerinenights.com/p/valparaiso) and [short novelist](https://tangerinenights.com/p/prime-a-l-enfance) :closed_book:, and an [amateur photographer](https://www.instagram.com/bobby__photo/) :camera:.
